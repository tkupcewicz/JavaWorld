University project in Java

After running you have to create some airplanes or ships from Control Panel.
Military planes are creatable only from Aircraft Carriers, so you have to spawn them first.
When you click some object on map, it's inspector pops out, probably will need some resizing by hand.
To ease catching fast flying vehicles I added vehicle speed slider on control panel, feel free to use it.
Time spent at airport/harbor is set up to 2 seconds, so don't panic if vehicles disappear after setting to 300% speed.
Passengers are automatically spawned proportionally to passenger vehicles and their capacity.
All buttons which are disable have partially implemented methods, or have some bugs.
